I am a Doctoral Researcher (FPI grant holder) in Computer Security and Privacy at Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV), Tarragona, Spain. Prior to joining URV, I was a PhD student in Electrical Engineering (Communication Systems) at Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, a program from which I withdrew for personal reasons. I have also worked as a remote Research Assistant at the University of Greenwich, UK, focusing on Security for AI and AI for Security, and previously as a Cybersecurity Researcher at the Iran Telecommunication Research Center (ITRC). I received my B.Sc. degree in 2018 and my M.Sc. degree in 2022, both in Electrical Engineering (Communication Systems), from K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. Since 2024, I have been an IEEE member and have been actively serving as a reviewer for reputable journals, including IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, Computer Networks, and Vehicular Communications. I am deeply interested in conducting and collaborating on high-quality research in the areas of security and privacy, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems. Alongside developing my technical expertise, I actively seek broader, general knowledge to foster personal and intellectual growth. My hobbies and interests include art and literature. I am an avid reader of novels.
